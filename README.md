# Scroll Reverse

An AppleScript that will reverse the scroll direction. Useful if you change this setting when switching between using the mouse and trackpad.

__To create an app that lets you run this script from your dock:__

Open main.scpt in (Apple) Script Editor
Rename the file and save as Application (hold option, File > Save As)
Add your app to the Accessibility list in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy
Drag the app from Finder into the dock

__To change the icon from it's default:__

Right-click on the app in Finder and select 'Get Info'
Open icon.png (or an image of your choosing) in Preview
Copy the image (Cmd + A, followed by Cmd + V)
Right-click on the app in Finder and select 'Get Info'
Left-click on the default image in the top left corner to select it
Paste the new image in it's place with Cmd + V
Clicking on the app in the dock will update the icon image (and reverse the direction of your scrolling!)
